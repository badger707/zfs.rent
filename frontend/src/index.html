<h2>purpose:</h2>
<p>
Simple cloud service to permanently store ZFS snapshots, ala:
<b><pre>
$ zfs send -v -R -I pool/snapshot_034 pool/snapshot_042 |\
    ssh marvin@marvin.zfs.rent zfs recv -v -Fu pool/snapshots
</pre></b>
</p>
<hr>

<h2>how:</h2>
<p>
We rent out KVM virtual machines with dedicated hard drives.
There is no sharing/over-committing.
</p>
<p>
When you rent a drive, you will
receive an email with the following:
<ul>
  <li>root password</li>
  <li>dedicated IPv4 address -- mapped to a subdomain of your choosing
    <ul>
        <li>e.g. marvin.zfs.rent</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>pre-formatted + mounted ZFS Storage Pool (zpool)
    <ul>
        <li>Although! Feel free to wipe the device and configure it from scratch.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
The drives are attached as pass-through as SATA devices.
<b>*They are raw.*</b>
There is no drive virtualization layer.
</p>
<p>
Users have a choice of:
<ul>
    <li><b>OpenZFS + CentOS 8.2</b> &nbsp;
      (maintence support until <strike>2029</strike>
      <a href="https://blog.centos.org/2020/12/future-is-centos-stream/">2021</a>)
    </li>
    <li><b>OpenZFS + Ubuntu 20.04</b> (maintence support until 2025)</li>
    <li><b>OpenZFS + Debian 10.7</b> &nbsp;(maintence support until 2024)</li>
    <li>
        <b>No Pre-installed OS</b>
        <ul>
            <li>i.e. attach a Linux .iso and install the OS via
                an HTTPS-tunneled VNC client.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>encryption:</h2>
<p>
ZFS supports native encryption and snapshotting. Once you have access to your
instance, you can configure your keys. Basically, once per boot, you need
to run <code>zfs load-key -a</code> and punch in your passphrase. Given our
datacenter's history of 99.95% uptime, we believe that re-entering your keys
will be a rarity. But if system power-loss occurs, user data will be
encrypted-at-rest. At any time, users can issue <code>sudo reboot</code>
to ensure their encrypted datasets are safe from physical seisure.

<h2>datacenter:</h2>

<h2>pricing:</h2>
See <a href="/pricing.html">zfs.rent/pricing</a>

<h2>rent-to-own:</h2>
<p>
For rent-to-own drives, we purchase a new Western Digital or Seagate drive
-- and then install it into our datacenter. After your equal payments have
been completed,
<b>*you own the drive*</b> -- at which point you can continue to colocate
your drive(s) by paying the standard service cost.
</p>
<p>
Check out our <a href="/pricing.html">pricing</a> for more details. But briefly:
<ul>
    <li>rental: ~$20/month for a 8 TB dedicated drive.</li>
    <li>rent-to-own: ~$20/month for a 8 TB dedicated drive that you own
        after 24-months. After your rental-term, colocation is ~$10/month
        thereafter.</li>
    <li>low-risk rental: ~$10/month for a 1 TB KVM drive</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
You can continue to rent colocation+bandwidth from us -- but whenever you
decide, we can unplug the drive and ship it to you, (within the United States).
Due to current export restrictions, we cannot ship to international users :/
</p>
<p>
... but if you have U.S. mail forwarding address, we can work with that...
</p>

<h2>setup time:</h2>
<p>
After a successful first payment, your KVM instance will be created and your
credentials will be emailed to you within 24 hours. The physical drive
will be attached soon after. (Although, since we are currently in beta,
it is not likely this will occur within 24 hours. But we predict that
we will be fully operation by the first week of December.)
